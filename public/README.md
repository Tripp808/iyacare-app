# Iy√†Care Images

To complete the setup of the homepage, you need to add two images to this directory:

1. `doctor-with-child.jpg` - The image of the healthcare provider with a child (the image you shared)
2. `maternal-care.jpg` - Another image related to maternal healthcare

## How to add the images

1. Save the image you shared as `doctor-with-child.jpg` in this directory
2. Find another suitable image related to maternal healthcare and save it as `maternal-care.jpg`

These images will fade in and out of each other in the hero section of the homepage.
