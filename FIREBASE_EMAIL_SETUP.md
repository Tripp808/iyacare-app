# ðŸ“§ Firebase Email Verification Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue Resolution

If users are being created in Firebase Auth but not receiving verification emails, follow these steps:

## âœ… Firebase Console Configuration

### 1. Check Authentication Settings
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `iyacare`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Authorized domains**
4. Ensure these domains are added:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `iyacare.site` (your production domain)
   - `www.iyacare.site` (with www prefix)

### 2. Email Template Configuration
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Templates**
2. Click on **Email address verification**
3. Customize the email template:
   ```
   Subject: Verify your email for IyÃ Care
   
   Hello,
   
   Follow this link to verify your email address for IyÃ Care:
   %LINK%
   
   If you didn't ask to verify this address, you can ignore this email.
   
   Thanks,
   The IyÃ Care Team
   ```

### 3. Project Settings
1. Go to **Project Settings** â†’ **General**
2. Ensure **Public-facing name** is set to: `IyÃ Care`
3. Ensure **Support email** is set to a valid email address

## ðŸ”§ Code Fixes Applied

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Loading State**: Added proper `setLoading(false)` after successful registration
2. **Email Verification**: Moved email verification after user creation in Firestore
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to not fail registration if email fails
4. **URL Configuration**: Changed verification URL to `/auth/login` instead of `/dashboard`

### Updated Functions:
- `signUp()` in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
- `sendVerificationEmail()` in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` 
- Registration error handling in `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Fix

### Test Registration:
1. Go to: [https://www.iyacare.site/auth/register](https://www.iyacare.site/auth/register)
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit the form
4. Should see: "Account created successfully!" message
5. Check your email for verification link

### If Email Still Doesn't Arrive:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Wait up to 10 minutes for delivery
3. Try using the "Resend verification email" option
4. Check Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Users to confirm user exists

## ðŸ”§ Manual Email Verification (Temporary Solution)

If needed, you can manually verify users in Firebase Console:
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Users**
2. Find the user account
3. Click the user
4. Toggle **Email verified** to **true**

## ðŸ“ž Support

- Check Firebase billing (free tier has email limits)
