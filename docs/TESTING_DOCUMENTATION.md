# IyàCare Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing strategies and procedures for the IyàCare healthcare management platform, covering different testing methodologies, data scenarios, and hardware/software specifications.

## 🧪 Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing

**Objective**: Test individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Components to Test:
- Authentication forms and validation
- Vital signs input validation
- Patient data processing
- Dashboard calculations
- AI risk assessment functions
- Form submission handlers

#### Example Unit Test Cases:
```javascript
// Authentication validation
test('validates email format correctly', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true);
  expect(validateEmail('invalid-email')).toBe(false);
});

// Vital signs validation
test('validates vital signs ranges', () => {
  expect(validateVitalSigns({
    systolic: 120,
    diastolic: 80,
    heartRate: 70
  })).toBe(true);
});

// Risk assessment calculation
test('calculates risk level correctly', () => {
  const vitals = {
    systolic: 180,
    diastolic: 100,
    heartRate: 90
  };
  expect(calculateRiskLevel(vitals)).toBe('high');
});
```

#### Tools and Framework:
- Jest for JavaScript testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Firebase Test SDK for database operations

### 2. Integration Testing

**Objective**: Test interactions between different components and external services.

#### Integration Points:
- Firebase Authentication flow
- Firestore database operations
- AI model API integration
- Real-time data synchronization
- Email verification process

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **User Registration Flow**
   - Register new user → Email verification → Profile creation
   - Expected: User account created with proper role assignment

2. **Vital Signs Recording**
   - Input vital signs → AI processing → Risk assessment → Data storage
   - Expected: Accurate risk calculation and persistent storage

3. **Patient Management**
   - Create patient → Add vital signs → Generate reports
   - Expected: Complete patient record with historical data

#### Testing Tools:
- Postman for API testing
- Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
